<pre><b>🤷 Why deb-detox?</b></pre>

**🌿deb-detox** Just like any finely tuned machine, your Debian system needs regular care to perform at its best. Over time, it quietly accumulates digital clutter — old logs, cached packages, orphaned dependencies, temporary files, outdated backups, and software you no longer use. Left unchecked, this buildup doesn't just hog valuable disk space — it drags down system performance, clutters your environment, and in some cases, can even create security risks. What once felt fast and responsive may start to feel sluggish and unreliable. Routine maintenance isn’t just a nice-to-have — it’s essential for keeping your system fast, secure, and efficient.
